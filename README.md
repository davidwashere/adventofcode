## TODO
- [ ] Create multi-stack
    - a stack structure that is backed by multiple independent stacks
    - so that you can push a string and an int together (for example) without having to create a custom struct
    - dynamic in that want to add '10 values', so be it without having a struct
    - stack.push(a, b, c)
    - a, b, c := stack.pop()
