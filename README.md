## TODO
- Triggerer
    - log values of env / config if defaults are used - currently only logs env
    - add cli flags to do the same things as env vars
    - remove the 'github' specific values, and have trigger execute an external command instead when time expires
    - allow start hour occur after end hour, essentially allowing for overnight times ie: start hour 12 end hour 11 = 23 hour total window

## AoC Discord Bot Ideas
- TODO: purge state branch history
- calc time from puzzle launch to first star
- reduce points (wat points) if complete puzzle late at night or during work hours
